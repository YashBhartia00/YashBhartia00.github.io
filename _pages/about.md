I am a second year undergraduate at [BITS Pilani, Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/). I am currently looking for research internships.
My research focuses are **Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, and AI in Games**. 

I am a core member of [Society for AI & Deep Learning (SAiDL)](https://www.saidl.in/) and [Natural Language Research Group (LRG)](https://lrg.saidl.in/) and share a keen interest in different ways of using Machine Learning in daily life.

I am also a member of [Developer's Society]() where I work and mentor juniors in the Game Development verticle. My published games can be found on [itch.io](). 

A collection of my [research]() and [projects]() can be viewed on this site along with my [CV]().
